## Prerequisites

Mac users need to run the following command to install the prerequisites:

```sh
$ brew install portaudio pkg-config go
```

## Installation

To install the tool, run the following command inside terminal:

```sh
$ go install github.com/bezmoradi/t2/cmd/t2@main
```

To make sure it's installed correctly in your `$GOPATH`, run the following command:
